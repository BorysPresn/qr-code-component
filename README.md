## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to effectively use Flexbox to center content both vertically and horizontally within a container. Additionally, I practiced creating a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes. Key takeaways include:
 - Using flex to manage the layout and ensure that elements are properly aligned and centered.
 - Implementing a mobile-first approach to ensure that the design works well on both mobile and desktop screens.

In future projects, I plan to:

 - Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts and alignments.
 - Improve my skills with JavaScript to add interactive features to my components.
